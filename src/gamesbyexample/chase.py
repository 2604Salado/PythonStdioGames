You are trapped in a maze with hungry robots! You don't know why robots
need to eat, but you don't want to find out. The robots are badly
programmed and will move directly towards you, even if blocked by walls.
You must trick the robots into crashing into each other (or dead robots)
without being caught. You have a random teleporter, but it only has
enough battery for {} teleports. Keep in mind, you and robots can slip
through corners!
